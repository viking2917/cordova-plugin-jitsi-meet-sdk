This is a fork of https://github.com/Zeno97/cordova-plugin-jitsi-meet-sdk. It uses Jitsi SDK version 7, rather than version 3 used by Zeno97, and corrects a few minor bugs.

(actually it uses Jitsi 8 on Android due to a "missing icon" bug in previous versions. Why iOS wasn't working for me on version 8 eludes me at present.)


# cordova-plugin-jitsi-meet-sdk
Cordova plugin for Jitsi Meet React Native SDK.

All options, feature flags and listeners are available. 

All feature flags available can be found here: https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet/blob/master/react/features/base/flags/constants.js

## Supported Platforms
- __Android__ >= 24
- __iOS__

## Installation
The plugin can be installed via Cordova-CLI

Install the latest head version
```
cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-jitsi-meet-sdk
```

## Usage
All parameters are optional except for room. You need to specify at least the room name.

- If serverURL is not specified by default is "https://meet.jit.si".
- _NOTE: DO NOT USE meet.jit.si. for production_. It is not supported for that,and has a 5 minute demo limit. Per their recommendations use either a self-hosted jitsi server or JAAS (https://8x8.vc).

- All feature flags not specified are in their default value.

- All boolean options by default are false.

- All string options by default are empty.

This is the minimal setup to enter into a conference
```js
JitsiMeet.startConference(
{
    room: "MyAmazingRoom",
});
```


And this is a complete example
```js
JitsiMeet.startConference(
{
